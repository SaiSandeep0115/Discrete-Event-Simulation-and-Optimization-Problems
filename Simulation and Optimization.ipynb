    "## 🔹 1: Discrete Event Simulation – Call Centre Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "A simulated call centre environment is modeled to analyze daily operations over a year. The simulation captures key service metrics such as call arrival, wait, and service times to evaluate performance against target benchmarks. This model helps identify operational inefficiencies and supports decision-making for service improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 2: Mixed Integer Linear Programming – Supply Chain Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "An optimization model is developed for a company producing and distributing three products to two regional warehouses. Considering constraints like production capacity, material availability, shipping costs, storage limits, and market balance, the model identifies an optimal plan that maximizes profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these projects illustrate the power of analytics in enhancing operational performance through data-driven modeling and optimization."

For this dataset we are imagining a business whose lines are open from 8:00am to 6:00pm, Monday to Friday. Four agents are on duty at any given time and each call takes an average of 5 minutes to resolve.\n",

As the data analytics expert, you have been brought in to analyze their performance and make recommendations to return the centre back to its target.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Gurobi optimizer successfully solved the manufacturing and distribution linear programming problem in 5 iterations within 0.01 seconds, achieving an **optimal profit of \\$30,350.00**. The optimal shipment plan suggests producing and shipping 200 units of Product A to Warehouse 1, no shipments of Product B, and 250 units of Product C to each Warehouse 1 and Warehouse 2. The constraints for production time (2400 hours) and material availability (4000 kg) are both fully utilized with zero slack, indicated by positive dual values of 4.0 and 5.0 respectively. Some demand limits and warehouse storage constraints remain underutilized, with slack values greater than zero, meaning there is still unused capacity for those parameters. The market balance constraint is not binding, as reflected by a zero dual value and a negative slack. Overall, the model efficiently balances production, material, demand, storage, and market constraints to maximize profit under the defined conditions."

    "The optimization results indicate that the most profitable manufacturing and distribution strategy involves producing and shipping 200 units of Product A to Warehouse 1, and 250 units of Product C each to Warehouses 1 and 2, while entirely excluding Product B from production. This strategy yields a maximum profit of $30,350, achieved by efficiently utilizing available production time and material resources, and by prioritizing products with the highest net returns after accounting for shipping and storage costs. The solution also satisfies all operational constraints, including warehouse storage limits and the market balance requirement that mandates at least 40% of total shipments be directed to Warehouse 1. The absence of Product B in the shipment plan suggests it is less cost-effective under the given constraints, reinforcing the importance of cost-benefit analysis in resource-limited production planning."

    "The optimization model successfully identified the most profitable manufacturing and distribution plan using PuLP, with a maximum achievable profit of $30,350. The solution suggests producing and shipping 200 units of Product A to Warehouse 1, 250 units of Product C to Warehouse 1, and 250 units of Product C to Warehouse 2, while Products B and A to Warehouse 2 are not shipped at all. This distribution meets all the resource constraints—production time and material limits—along with demand limits and warehouse capacities. Moreover, it satisfies the market balance condition by ensuring that at least 40% of the total shipped units are sent to Warehouse 1. This result highlights the efficiency of optimization techniques in maximizing profit while respecting operational limitations in a supply chain scenario."
